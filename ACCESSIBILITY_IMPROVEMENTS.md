## Issue #15: Add Keyboard Navigation to Workshop Registration Form

### ✅ Improvements Implemented

- ✅ Added `aria-required="true"` for screen readers
- ✅ Added `aria-invalid` state management
- ✅ Added `autoComplete="name"` for browser autofill
- ✅ Added `placeholder` for better UX
- ✅ Added focus ring: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2`
- ✅ Added visual required indicator with `*`

**Phone Number Field:**
- ✅ Added `name="phone_number"` attribute

- ✅ Added `aria-label="Select your Django experience level"`
- ✅ Added `placeholder="Select your experience level"` to SelectValue
- ✅ Added focus ring styling
- ✅ Fully keyboard navigable (Space/Enter to open, Arrow keys to select, Enter to confirm)

#### 4. **Checkbox Accessibility**
- ✅ Added `aria-describedby="attendance-description"`
- ✅ Added `id="attendance-description"` to label for semantic connection
- ✅ Added `cursor-pointer` to label for better UX
- ✅ Added focus ring styling

#### 5. **Submit Button**
- ✅ Added `aria-label` with dynamic state (submitting vs. ready)
- ✅ Added focus ring styling
- ✅ Maintains disabled state during submission

#### 6. **Visual Focus Indicators**
All interactive elements now have clear focus indicators:
```css
focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2
```
This creates a 2px ring with offset for better visibility.
